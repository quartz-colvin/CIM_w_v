# Introduction

- Kia orana kātoa! Ko Quartz tōku ingoa. 

- Kā tuatua au nō te Māori Kūki 'āirani i tēia rā.

# Research questions

1. How does duration of w~v vary by island?

2. How does intensity of w~v vary by island? 

3. Does voicing of w~v vary by island? 

4. Which island(s) have more or less [w] tokens surfacing instead of [v]s? 

--

## Why though?

It's known across both Aotearoa (NZ) Māori and CIM that some speakers regularly pronounce [v] as [w], but it isn't clear to anyone who does this more and what conditions it!

# Cook Islands Māori (background)

- Eastern Polynesian language, VSO is the unmarked word order

- Closely related, but definitely different from Aotearoa Māori

- Classified as Endangered and there is little intergenerational transmission :(

--

- I work as a contract transcriber on a project documenting CIM, so I got this data from my supervisors (**Ake ē Rolando, meitaki!**)

## Data overload

- **Speaker:** just their initials (no 'id' column)

- **Island:**  either Atiu, Mauke, Penrhyn, or Rarotonga

- **Filename:** refers to the audio file this was extracted from

- **PreviousLabel**/**FollowingLabel:** phoneme that precedes/follows

- **Start**/**End:** the start and end times for that phoneme

- **Duration:** *total* duration of the phoneme

- **Percent:** the 20% 50% and 80% marks of the phoneme's total duration

- **F0.point:** f0 measured in Hz at that percent of the phoneme's duration

- **F2_midpoint:** f2 measured in Hz at the midpoint of the phoneme

- **Intensity_midpoint:** intensity midpoint of the phoneme

# Results 

**Duration**

- Penrhyn has the longest average w~v durations and Rarotonga has the shortest

- Penrhyn has the largest range in durations

- Atiu and Mauke have pretty similar w~v durations

--

**Intensity**

- Penrhyn has the lowest average intensity midpoints (its entire range is lowest)

- Mauke and Rarotonga have pretty high ranges, but for Rarotonga the values are more concentrated around the mean (the box itself is smaller)

- Atiu has the smallest range for intensity and the values are concentrated around the mean

# Voicing by island

### Useful info

**F0**

- [w] can be voiceless, so its F0 is either super low or absent (below than 80 Hz = voiceless)

- [v] is voiced, so F0 is always there, and is a higher F0 than for [w]

--

### What I'm doing

- We use f0 values for the target phoneme to see how voicing for w~v differs across the four islands in this data set. 

- F0 values were extracted at the 20%, 50% and 80% points of the duration of the target phoneme. 

---
# F0 by island 


**fill in???**















---
# F2 by island

**Why F2?**

- [w] has a lower F2 than [v]

**Note:**

- F2 values were only extracted at the midpoint of the phoneme.

# Formant results 

### Great, so what does this all mean?

**F0**

- Mauke is the only one that seems to *regularly* have voiceless [w] in place of 'v', but it also has the biggest overall range for f0 Hz

- the other 3 islands typically have f0 \> 100 Hz, so these tokens are voiced

- **SO,** we would expect f2 values to also say that Mauke has more [w] than [v] surfacing


---
# Formant results 

### The voicing question

- Based on the f2 boxplot, the lowest mean f2 is Atiu, then Penrhyn, Mauke, then Rarotonga

- a lower f2 indicates [w], so Atiu should, on average, have more [w]-surfacing and Rarotonga should have the least occurrances of [w]-surfacing (more [v])

- **So, it seems that f0 was not a good predictor for the [w] vs. [v] question, but it did reveal that Mauke has a higher rate of voiceless [w], when [w] is realized**

---
# Formant results

### The w~v question 

- a 'low f2' that indicates [w] is \<850 Hz

- **all** of these 4 islands have instances of [w], and their means are all slightly (or much) higher than this cut-off, so they all averagely surface as [v]

- based on the boxplots for f2, all of the islands except Penrhyn have a lot of tokens where 'v' surfaces as [w]
